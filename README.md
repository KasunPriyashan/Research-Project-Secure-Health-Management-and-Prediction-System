SECURE HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PREDICTION SYSTEM FOR CHRONIC DISEASES
Main Objective:
The aim of the project is to develop a system capable of detecting diabetes and
cardiovascular disease based on a user's LIPID profile report or fasting blood
pressure report. If the patient's condition is determined to be critical, the
system will provide contact Information of cardiologists, endocrinologists, and
diabetologists, as well as the nearest hospital, medical center, and pharmacy.
The proposed system can estimate individual health insurance-billed medical
costs based on the LIPID profile report or fasting blood pressure report. In
addition, the proposed system will ensure patient confidentiality and privacy
by encrypting data at rest.
Main Research questions:
Indirect diseases such as diabetics and heart disease cause inactivity and
laziness of people. This is a direct cause of people's unhealthy lifestyles.
According to the WHO, the number of diabetic patients increased by 3% between
2000 and 2019. According to the National Diabetes Statistical Report in the
United States, one in five Americans are unaware they have diabetic, and eight
in ten are unaware they have pre diabetic. In 2019, the number of individuals
with diabetes was 463 million. According to forecasts, this figure is expected
to increase by 578 million by 2030 and is projected to reach 700 million by 2045.
The most important element of these diseases is that they are treatable with
prompt and adequate care. People rarely undergo tests to determine whether or
not they have chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Lack of
cardiologists, endocrinologists, and diabetologists is one of the primary
reasons behind this. There is instance only one cardiologist, endocrinologist,
and diabetologist for every three districts.
Existing systems do not permit patients to detect diabetes and heart disease
using health records such as the LIPID profile report or the fasting blood
pressure report, as determined by the research team. In addition, existing
technologies are unable of determining whether a patient's condition is critical
or not.

Some of the major crucial factors for chronic disease are high usage of alcohol products, lack of physical activates and also the risk increases if parents have the disease. But one of the main issues of existing studies and systems that they don’t consider critical factors like those to the prediction diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Another main issue that research team identified was that currently existing systems don’t allow patients to input their health reports and records as images. Additionally, existing systems do not provide proper confidentiality and privacy of health records. Now a days people more consider about privacy and also there are policies such as HIPPA to ensure the confidently of health records, in that case lack of privacy and confidentiality can discourage patients from using prediction systems.
The primary objective of “develop a systematic approach for image processing, extract information from patient reports” is to extract the cholesterol total, cholesterol HDL, cholesterol LDL, triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol parameters for cardiovascular disease prediction. Then those extracted data will be passed for the prediction diabetes and cardiovascular disease. And the main goal of “design a model to detect the present health condition” is to determine the patient’s current health status. The patient’s alcohol intake, tobacco usage, level of physical activeness and genetic susceptibility to the disease has to be considered when predicting the diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The supervised learning machine learning model will be used to determine the patient’s health status.

According to the World Health Organization, chronic diseases such as diabetes account for 71% of all mortality worldwide. This is an alarming statistic, and we must take action to address this issue. While there have been many research works for predicting diabetes using simple inputs, there are no research works related to diabetes detection using the most accurate input data that is taken from the original medical reports of the patient. Early detection can help to prevent or slow the progression of the disease.
Detect diabetics of the user according to data that provided by the user and analysis the condition of the patient then display doctor and nearest medical center information to the patient. The data used to predict diabetes was obtained by an image processing component. My objective is to use this information and the best possible algorithm to accurately predict diabetes cases. To improve the precision of my findings, I want to use support vector machine. The algorithm sorts people into different groups based on whether or not they have diabetes, and it also rates how serious their illness is. The algorithm then evaluates the inputs, providing a percentage of healthy values and recommendations for upholding them. Identify and categorize each patient according to their level of criticality. Give recommendations for each patient, Display nearby doctors according to their status using their location, Sensitive medical information will be encrypted by encryption algorithm

Traditional heart disease identification can be costly and require specialist doctors, which can be a challenge for people living in rural areas. But with our system, we can provide accurate predictions for heart disease identification and even display the closest hospitals and pharmacies for users. Our system can analyse a patient's condition and provide a criticality level to determine their healthy or heart disease state.This can be incredibly helpful for healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients and recommending lifestyle changes or medication to lower their risk.
Detect heart disease using data extracted from medical reports, providing the user with a highly accurate result. I would use the logistic regression model to accurately predict heart disease, as heart problems are more severe than other diseases. According to predictive outcomes and patients' health status When a patient's condition is considered life-threatening, they are typically directed to the nearest hospital and pharmacy. This makes it easier for the patient to determine whether or not they require treatment. This allows for the systematic identification of the type of disease from which a patient is suffering. The system can access patient information, which is editable with access authorities.

My sub objective of this research project is to create a strong and accurate model that can accurately predict individual medical insurance costs for patients with chronic diseases within a secure health management system. By developing such a model, healthcare providers and insurers can effectively estimate insurance premiums and allocate resources for individuals with chronic diseases, ultimately improving the affordability and accessibility of healthcare services.
The processing and grouping of an Internet-downloaded data collection of medical cost personal datasets.  First choose the appropriate machine learning model that can best predict the medical expenses based on the available data. The model could include logistic regression model called linear regression. After that, train the model using those data sets and check the accuracy of the model. Create the web applications part to allow users to input relevant data to predict individual health insurance-billed medical expenses. After that we can monitor the performance of the machine learning models in production and make any necessary adjustments to ensure their continued accuracy and reliability.
